(ns falx.space
  "Contains operations on space and spacial concepts such as cells, levels, layers, slices.

  Space is discretized into cells, each cell representing a point on a level. The level is assumed to be symbolic, e.g \"map-1\"

  Each cell can contain one or more identities, which are assumed to be symbolic representations of something else, e.g
  :fred. One can manipulate the position of identities directly with `move`, or `change-positions`.
  Each identity can be in only one cell at a time.

  The pairing of an identity positioned in space is called an `object`.
  Each object in the space can be placed into a particular layer. A layer on a particular level is called a `slice`.
  Add objects with `add-object`."
